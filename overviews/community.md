# Clojure Community

## Mailing Lists

## IRC

`#clojure` at freenode.

You can find irc logs at <http://clojure-log.n01se.net/>.


## Code repositories

Most folks host their projects at github, and most pure Clojure
library distributions (with the exception of contrib) are available at
[Clojars](https://clojars.org/) (via
[Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/)).


## Core development

See the [Clojure Confluence
wiki](http://dev.clojure.org/display/design/Home) for full details on
how Core development is handled.

Coordination of development efforts happen on the development mailing
list, on the Confluence wiki, and make use of the [JIRA bug and issue
tracker](http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ).

Although Clojure and the contrib libraries all have homes at github,
pull-requests are not accepted. All core development happens via JIRA
and the Confluence wiki.
