## Overview

As of fall 2012, Clojure has 6 books published about it, plus one coming up about ClojureScript. This guide lists them in
reverse chronological order and intended to provide a very brief overview of each. It is by no means comprehensive and
may be quite opinionated. The goal is to identify books that are more useful to newcomers than others and
recommend books that cover recent releases of Clojure (1.3+).

### The Joy of Clojure

By Michael Fogus and Chris Houser.
