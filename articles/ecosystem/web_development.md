## What Version of Clojure Does This Guide Cover?

This guide covers Clojure 1.4.



## Some Options

Below are some of the various options available for web development
with Clojure, listed roughly by size.



### Ring and Compojure

Perhaps the simplest and most minimal setup is to use only Ring and
Compojure. To get started, see the [basic web development
tutorial](/articles/tutorials/basic_web_development.html).



### lib-noir

In addition to Ring and Compojure, you might also make use of
[lib-noir](https://github.com/noir-clojure/lib-noir) --- web
development libraries split out from Noir (see below).



### Noir

[Noir](http://webnoir.org/) is a micro-framework based on Ring
and Compojure.



### Conjure

[Conjure](https://github.com/macourtney/Conjure) is a Rails-like
framework, the aim of which is to simplify the development of
database-backed web applications.
