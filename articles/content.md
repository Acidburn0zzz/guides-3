## Overview

[CDS](https://github.com/clojuredocs/cds) is a categorized and
manifold collection of guides for the Clojure programming language and
its ecosystem.

CDS recognizes that different Clojure users have different level of expertise
and separates content into several groups:

 * Tutorials
 * Core language guides
 * Ecosystem (tools, libraries, community, books) guides
 * Cookbooks


## Tutorials

A swift introduction to the Clojure language, covering most of the
basics.
