# CDS: A Clojure Doc Site

An assorted collection of tutorials, overviews, topical guides, and
other documentation (all by various authors) for the Clojure
programming language. Currently available [here, in lovely
html](http://www.unexpected-vortices.com/clojure/cds/index.html).

The goal is to eventually have these documents hosted at
doc.clojure.org.

What's *not* here:

  * Cheatsheets. Those can be found at
    [clojure.org/cheatsheet](http://clojure.org/cheatsheet), or with
    tooltips at
    [jafingerhut.github.com](http://jafingerhut.github.com).
  * API reference docs. Those can currently be found (with examples)
    at [Clojuredocs](http://clojuredocs.org/).

All docs in the clojure-docs-collection are distributed under the
[CC BY 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license
and are copyright their respective primary author(s).

For some guidance on writing great documentation, see
<http://jacobian.org/writing/great-documentation/>.

Note to potential contributors: if you'd like to make changes to an
existing document, please attempt to stay true to the author's
original style and intent. If you chafe at this idea, you might
consider writing your own separate document for inclusion in this
collection. `:)`

If you are the primary author of a substantial document, you might
include your name in an `# Author` section near the end of it. If you
have made substantial contributions to an existing document, perhaps
add your name to a `# Contributors` section. Otherwise, all
contributors are encouraged to add their name to the CONTRIBUTORS
file.
