# CDS: A Clojure Doc Site

An assorted collection of tutorials, overviews, topical guides, and
other documentation (all by various authors) for the Clojure
programming language. Currently available [here, in lovely
html](http://www.unexpected-vortices.com/clojure/cds/index.html).

## Goals

The goal is to eventually have these documents hosted at
doc.clojure.org.

What's *not* here:

  * Cheatsheets. Those can be found at
    [clojure.org/cheatsheet](http://clojure.org/cheatsheet), or with
    tooltips at
    [jafingerhut.github.com](http://jafingerhut.github.com).
  * API reference docs. Those can currently be found (with examples)
    at [Clojuredocs](http://clojuredocs.org/).


## License

All docs in the clojure-docs-collection are distributed under the
[CC BY 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license
and are copyright their respective primary author(s).


## Resources

## Contributing

If you are the primary author of a substantial document, you might
include your name in a `# Contributors` section near the end of it,
noting that you are the original author. If you have made substantial
contributions to an existing document, you might add your name to the
`# Contributors` section. Otherwise, all contributors are encouraged
to add their name to the CONTRIBUTORS file.

Note to potential contributors: if you'd like to make changes to an
existing document, please attempt to stay true to the author's
original style and intent. If you chafe at this idea, you might
consider writing your own separate document for inclusion in this
collection. `:)`
